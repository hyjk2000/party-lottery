## Origin

This was a toy app for use in my wedding back in 2013. I could not find a suitable and good-looking lottery app so I wrote one in a couple of hours. Some friends of mine showed interest in it. Since then I added a configuration panel and several other features to make it a real app.

## Plan

Years later I found this app is still pretty useful. But the code was written in a rush and is too messy to work on.

- [x] Rewrite JavaScript in ECMAScript 2015
- [x] Rewrite CSS using Sass and Autoprefixer
- [x] Remove jQuery & Modernizr (along with ancient browsers support)
- [x] ~~Package with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/)~~
